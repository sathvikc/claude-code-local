# The model-aware restart logic here was diagnosed by 0xshugo in PR #5
# (nicedreamzapp/claude-code-local#5). That PR as a whole had compatibility
# issues we couldn't merge, but this specific observation — that launchers
# only checked `lsof -i :4000` and would happily connect to the wrong model
# if one was already running — was the correct diagnosis, and this file
# fixes it.
